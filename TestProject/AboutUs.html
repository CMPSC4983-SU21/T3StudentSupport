                    <h3>ECU SSS History</h3>

                    <p>Student Support Services began on ECU's campus as Special Services in 1972. 
                        The name was changed to Project Goals and then later to the Learning Resources 
                        and Counseling Center. Eventually, the name Student Support Services was adopted. 
                        The program remained on campus until the grant ended in 2007. In September 2010, 
                        ECU was again awarded the Student Support Services grant, but it would be under 
                        the new name of sECUre success. In September 2015, a new grant was established 
                        and now operates as Student Support Services.

                    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
                    <p>
                    Student Support Services' mission is to assist students who are "at risk" in breaking the cycle of underachievement,
                    experience post-secondary success, and create better lives for themselves, their families and their communities.

                    <h3>A Brief History of TRiO</h3>
                    <p>President Lyndon B. Johnson's "War on Poverty" initiative led to the creation 
                        of the TRiO programs. The first program, Upward Bound, was created with the 
                        Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Talent Search followed in 1965 as a part of 
                        the Higher Education Act of 1965. The third program, Special Services, now known 
                        as Student Support Services, was authorized in Higher Education Act of 1968. When 
                        Student Support Services was added as the third program, the name TRIO was adopted 
                        to represent the programs. In subsequent years and reauthorizations of Higher Education 
                        Act, several other programs were added (Upward Bound Math and Science, Veterans Upward 
                        Bound, Educational Opportunity Center, and the Ronald E. McNair Post-Baccalaureate 
                        Achievement program) but like the programs, the name TRiO has stayed the test of time.
